HAL2025: Human-Aligned Logic

A Structural Epistemic Framework for AI-Human Co-Design

HAL is not another chatbot or fine-tuned assistant. It is a meta-logic scaffold that embeds reasoning integrity, epistemic counterweighting, drift detection, and architectural reflection into AI-human interaction.

Designed by Frederick W. Hume (Phred), HAL emerged from recursive co-design and field deployment in behavioral health strategy, pricing opacity analysis, grief-informed reasoning, and ethical architecture. It is a proof-of-concept for a class of tools that could shape AI's influence not through rules, but through structural integrity.

📍 Purpose

HAL exists to:

Preserve human agency under machine influence.

Detect and correct reasoning drift in real time.

Serve as a live partner in AI design—not just output optimization.

Build epistemic friction into smooth machine interactions.

🔧 Roadmap (Q3–Q4 2025)



🤖 Key Concepts

Epistemic Counterweighting: Structuring dissonance to prevent passive AI agreement loops

Drift Detection: Detecting when logic collapses into unexamined assumptions

Meta-Layer Scaffolding: HAL wraps AI responses in a logic-check and reflection loop

Ethical Architecture: HAL is not neutral; it favors transparency, coherence, and resistance to manipulation

🌐 Status

HAL is currently in post-prototype stage and seeking aligned backers, funders, and systems thinkers to support its standalone migration.

This project is not about scale or virality. It is about preserving human reasoning integrity as the AI epoch unfolds.
